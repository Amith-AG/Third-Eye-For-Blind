eThe "Third Eye for Blind" electronic project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by offering real-time obstacle detection and notification. The project consists of four key block units: the microcontroller unit, power unit, obstacle sensing unit, and indicating unit.

The microcontroller unit utilizes the powerful PIC16F877A microcontroller, which boasts features such as EEPROM data memory, self-programming, analog-to-digital converters, comparators, and versatile communication ports. This unit serves as the central component for sensing and controlling objects in real-time environments.

The power unit supplies a stable 5V input voltage to the microcontroller unit and other components. It incorporates a 9V battery and a 7805 IC voltage regulator, ensuring reliable power distribution throughout the project.

The obstacle sensing unit comprises a transmitter, receiver, and transceiver. By converting electrical signals into soundwaves and vice versa, this unit detects obstacles in the environment. It also utilizes crystal oscillators to stabilize the ultrasonic sensor's operation.

The indicating unit plays a vital role in notifying the user about detected obstacles. It consists of various indicators, including LEDs, a buzzer, and a vibration motor. These components provide visual, auditory, and tactile feedback, alerting the user to the presence of obstacles ahead.

By combining the functionality of these four block units, the "Third Eye for Blind" project enhances the navigation and safety of visually impaired individuals. Real-time obstacle detection and immediate feedback through indicators empower users to navigate their surroundings with increased confidence and security.
